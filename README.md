# funny-news-generator
This is a Random Funny News Generator written in Python.

It creates absurd and humorous “fake headlines” by randomly combining:

A quirky subject (e.g., Sleep-Deprived Coder, Overconfident Hacker)

A bizarre action (e.g., debugging life decisions, hacking a vending machine)

An unexpected place (e.g., in the bathroom labeled ‘404’, on Mars but with lag)

A laughing emoji for extra fun 😆

The program runs in a loop and keeps generating random “funny news” until the user types exit.

Example Output
Grammar Police Officer explaining memes in binary on the dark web cooking show 😂💀
Overconfident Hacker hacking a vending machine in the Forbidden Folder 🤣🔥

Features

Endless random combinations for unique headlines every time.
